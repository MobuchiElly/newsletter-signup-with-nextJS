## My process
I began building the mobile version first before moving on to desktop and tablet versions as well as small phones below the present mobile screen size. I was able to achieve this easily by customising my tailwindconfig.js file to suit my required screen sizes, colours, bordersizes as well as other configurations. I utilised regular expressions to validate email entered and only allowed routing to the success page when the email is verified. 

### Built with

- [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile and desktop responsive

### What I learned

I used this project as a tool to learn Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

Typescript and NextJS App router are my major focus at the moment. I am currently building a project using App router hoping to learn more and would be focusing on Typrescript when I am done.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states) - This helped me in implementing the hover effect.
